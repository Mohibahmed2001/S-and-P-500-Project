# S&P 500
So backstory on this project that I am creating. A half a year ago I created a trading software bot in C++ using think or swim API. I made good progress on the project and it was up and running. However think or swim got bought out and their API was no longer able to be used.

So I decided to the same project over again but this time in python using Pandas, Numpy, and XLSX writer. One of the things I wanted to learn was to deepen my understanding of these libraries and the first part in how I approached this was creating a equal weighted S&P 500. I am attempting to create and equal weight version of the S&P 500 and be able to know how much of each stock I should purchase. If you would like to do it yourself the code is here but you will have to update the values.
